# This file keeps the snare directory in git while ignoring the audio files
# Place your snare drum samples (.wav, .mp3, etc.) in this directory
# They will be ignored by git but the directory structure will be preserved

## Expected files:
- audio1.wav
- audio2.wav
- audio3.wav
- ... (your snare drum samples)
