# Models Directory

This directory contains trained machine learning models for audio classification.

## Current Models

### Drum Classifier (`drum_classifier.pkl`)
- **Type**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Purpose**: Classify kick vs snare drum sounds
- **Accuracy**: 83.3%
- **Features**: 25 audio features (MFCC, spectral, time-domain)
- **Training Data**: 20 drum samples (10 kick + 10 snare)

## Model Files (Ignored by Git)

The following model files are too large for git and are ignored:
- `*.pkl` - Scikit-learn models
- `*.h5` - Keras/TensorFlow models
- `*.onnx` - ONNX format models
- `*.tflite` - TensorFlow Lite models
- `*.pt`, `*.pth` - PyTorch models

## Usage

Load models in your Python code:
```python
import pickle

# Load drum classifier
with open('models/drum_classifier.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model_data = pickle.load(f)
    
model = model_data['model']
classes = model_data['class_names']
```

## Model Training

Train new models using:
```bash
python scripts/train_drums.py --save_model
```

This will create a new `drum_classifier.pkl` file in this directory.
